Description:
•	Implemented Message Templates for:
1) Actual Message which contains length of payload, type of message, payload and default read write methods
2) Choke which contains message type as CHOKE and no payload
3) UnChoke which contains message type as UNCHOKE and no payload
4) Interested which contains message type as INTERESTED and no payload
5) NotInterested which contains message type as NOTINTERESTED and no payload
6) Request which has message type as REQUEST and sends request for payloads pieceIndex
7) Have which has message type as HAVE and says it has following payloads pieceIndex
8) Piece has message type as PIECE and it merges following payload to actual
9) BitField has message type as BITFIELD and sends byte[] of payload
10) Handshake message has header "P2PFILESHARINGPROJ", 10 bits zero, and 4 byte peerID.
•	Created a peerProcess class to create a thread for each peers
•	Capturing logs for each message type and event using Event Logger and LogHelper
•	Created a FileOrganizer class to plit the mesaages into a particular size, merge parts into a file, convert file parts from byte array to actual format and vice versa
•	Created a ConnectionOrganizer class to keep a track of all the communication between peers
•	Created a PeerOrganizer class to handle unchocking - chocking behavious among peers
•	Adding a peer process thread class to call the individual modules of implementation like FileOrganizer, PeerOrganizer, ConnectionOrganizer

How To run
